CS4002 - Lab 2, Data Processing / GitHub

The source file should be fully compatible with Windows and OS X. It has been tested on a Windows 8.1 machine. The usage is simple - open up a terminal window, type in

	javac lab.java

The program will ask you for the location of the source data file. Tested against "C:\zoo.data" and it worked. For OS X, make sure you are using the full file path. For example, running it from the same folder should be done through "/Users/$USERNAME$/Courses/CS4002/Lab2/zoo.data". After this, the program will output a file called properData.csv with all of requirements for formatting.
