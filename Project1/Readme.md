In order to start everything:

1) Enter a number into the "Number of live cells" input box. A good range is 100-350 or so.
2) Hit the "Generate" button to create a random grid of live cells - repeat until you find a grid you like.
3) Press the "Play" button and watch the simulation run.
4) To stop the simulation at any time, press the "Stop" button.

Note: The simulation will not run if the number of life cells is left blank. The simulation will not stop, unless the "Stop" button is pressed.
